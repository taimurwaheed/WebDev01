    <!-- <center><h1>Quaid's Legacy</h1></center> -->
    <p> 
        Born on December 25, 1876, in a prominent mercantile family in Karachi and educated at the 
        Sindh Madrassat-ul-Islam and the Christian Mission School at is birth place, Jinnah joined 
        the Lincoln's Inn in 1893 to become the youngest Indian to be called to the Bar, three years later.   
    </p>

    <u><h2>Early Life</h2></u>
    <p>Starting out in the legal profession with nothing to fall back upon except 
        his native ability and determination, 
        young Jinnah rose to prominence and became Bombay's most successful lawyer, as few did, 
        within a few years.</p>
    
    <u><h2>Political Career</h2></u>
    <p>
        In January 1910, Jinnah was elected to the newly-constituted Imperial Legislative Council. 
        All through his parliamentary career, which spanned some four decades, he was probably the
        powerful voice in the cause of Indian freedom and Indian rights. Jinnah, who was also the 
        first Indian to pilot a private member's Bill through the Council, soon became a leader of a 
        group inside the legislature
    </p>

    <u><h2>Foundation of Pakistan</h2></u>
    <p>
        "The foundations of your State have been laid and it is now for you to build and build as 
        quickly and as well as you can". In accomplishing the task he had taken upon himself on the 
        morrow of Pakistan's birth, Jinnah had worked himself to death, but he had, to quote Richard 
        Symons, "contributed more than any other man to Pakistan's survival". He died on 11 September, 1948.
